Hi everyone, my name is **Danny Nguyen** and I am a 3rd year computer science student at the *University of California, San Diego.* I love coding in Java and Python and I am looking forward to becoming good at programming and suceeding in this class. 
>Great just isn’t good enough 

is one of Google’s 10 principles created in the earliest years of operation. “Great just isn’t good enough” in regards to the individual does not mean one must become the best but rather one must strive to become the best. This is a quote that really sums up my view towards education and career.

this was my first line of code

`public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
    }
}`
